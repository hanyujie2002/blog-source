Have you ever heard RSS? If the reply of you is "Nope", I am glad to tell you.

### What's RSS?

The full name of RSS(~~not SSR~~) is really simple syndication, which suggests that it's a tool for getting information from many informations sources. It's very prevalent around 2010, despite the fact that only a few people who still love the open script of the internet knowing about it now.

### Why RSS?

~~Why not?~~
Today, it's widely recognized that the Internet is getting more and more closed in mobile age created by Steve Jobs which in the entrance of the Internet is apps. The nature of apps is closed and there is usually no public link of mobile apps. Many produck managers' dream is to make a independent ecosystem so that the customer have to use their producks. Then, the customers' data is controled by the app, not themselves, which is really disgusting. What's even wrose, most people don't care about where their data belong to.
However, if you are not one of those people who don't care about where their data belong to, you'd better try RSS.
