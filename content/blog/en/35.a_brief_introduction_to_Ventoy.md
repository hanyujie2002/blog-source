# A brief introduction to Ventoy

The first time I make a bootable USB disk is to install Ubuntu in my Lenovo laptop by Rufus which is very inconvenient as **all files are deleted after reformatting the U disk** and **only one system could be in the U disk** which means you have to reformat it again if you want to try another system.

If you are having the same trouble as me, Ventoy is a good choice then.

## How to get quick started with Ventoy?

1. [https://www.ventoy.net](https://www.ventoy.net) enter this official website and install it as the instruction.

2. Insert your U drive and make sure that your computer have detected it.

3. Follow the default settings and reformat your u disk, take caution that all your files in that u disk will be deleted so back up important files in it.

4. Put the ISO file in your reformatted U disk and a bootable disk is done.

5. You could use your U disk as a normal drive while it's a bootable disk which could contain more than one ISO files only restricted by the facility of your U disk.
