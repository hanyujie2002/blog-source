# Does copyright protection harm creation?

## Background

Yesterday I had read an article about the strict copyright protection of Nintendo which arise the debate whether copyright protection benefits the creation.

Two opposing views exists about this issue.

* The copyright protection is harmful for creation as authors couldn't use those proprietary material freely. What's more, the copyright protection inhibits the circulation of creative works making people hard to contact with those works.

* The copyright protection benefits creation as the authors could get the profits by selling their works which encourages them to continuously make good jobs.

## My view

In my opinion, There are two kinds of creation: one is based on interest, and the other is based on profits. The copyright protection will definitely harm the former one and benefit the latter one. Whether to protect copyright depends on your preference.
