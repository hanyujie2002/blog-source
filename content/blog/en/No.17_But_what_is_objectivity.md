# But what is objectivity?
	
$\color{red}{Warning:\;This\;article\;is\;subjective.}$

## Background

Nowadays, many people condemn some the other people or institution "not objective" whose mantra is "As a XX(like an open source institution or commercial company), you should be objective and not express any view on OO(like politic)", which sounds "objective". Are those who demand objectivity from others really objective? **The answer to this is "Nope"**.

## Basic problem: What is objectivity?

Whether one object is objective or subjective is a philosophical problem. 

### Math and natural science

One is objective when it's science based and measurable, not one's like or dislike, so personal opinions must be subjective.

So, from this aspect, **math and natural science** are objective. 

### Is Wikipedia objective?

Wikipedia is a famous encyclopedia which shows each opinion and don't judge them as far as possible. **In my opinion**, it's objective as it shows few emotional leans most of the time.

## My answer to the problem in background

**In my opinion, they are not objective** as in fact they show emotional leans that depress other opinion(usually selectively).
