# An Introduction to Markdown

## What is Markdown?

* Markdown is a computer language
* Easy to type, easy to copy, easy to read
* Simplified HTML
  
## Why Markdown?

* While you are using MS Word, you may put too much attention on the typesetting and the fonts, but not on the text you want to show.
* When you want to type mathematical formulas, you have to do a lot of complex things. What's more, the mathematical formulas can't be copied to the other platforms.

## How to use Markdown?

* When you want to show that something is **important** just like this, you can use `**word**`, this is really easy, isn't it?
* When you want to make your word *Italic*, you can use `*word*`.

## Type list

 Typing list is also easy. Whether you had learned HTML, you could easily accept the concepts of ol(ordered list) and ul(unordered list). Ordered list is just like this:

1. First // Type `1. First`
2. Second // Type `2. Second`
3. Third // Type `3. Third`

Unordered list if just list like this:

* First // Type `* First`
* Second // Type `* Second`
* Third // Type `* Third`

## Type Mathematical formulas

* When you want to type $a^b$, just type `$a^b$`
* when you want to type $a_b$, just type `$a_b$`
* when you want to type $\frac{a}{b}$, just type `$\frac{a}{b}$`

 y &= mx + b \\\\
   &= ab + c
