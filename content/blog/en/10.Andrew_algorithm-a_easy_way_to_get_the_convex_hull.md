# Andrew algorithm-a easy way to get the convex hull

### Background knowledge

The convex hull means the outermost points in the two-dimentional plane.

### Andrew algorithm

The main idea of this algorithm is showed below:

1. put these points in a list and sort this list by the key $x$ and then $y$.
2. iter from the first point the end point, and judge whether pop out the stack or press the point in the stack by cross.
3. iter from the second from the bottom to the second point, do the same as above.

The code is here:

```python
def get_cross(a, b, c):
    u = (b[0]-a[0], b[1]-a[1])
    v = (c[0]-b[0], c[1]-b[1])

    cross = u[0]*v[1] - u[1]*v[0]
    return cross


def andrew(n, l):  # n is the number of these points, l is the list which contain these points
    l = [(0, 0)] + sorted(l)
    
    tb_l = []
    for i in l[1:]:
        while len(tb_l) >= 2 and get_cross(tb_l[-2], tb_l[-1], i) <= 0:
            del tb_l[-1]
        tb_l.append(i)

    f_cvx = len(tb_l)
    for i in l[n-1:1:-1]:
        while len(tb_l) > f_cvx and get_cross(tb_l[-2], tb_l[-1], i) <= 0:
            del tb_l[-1]
        tb_l.append(i)

    return tb_l
```
