# Fibonacci series

### Background

Fibonacci series problem has been a classic problem.
Fibonacci series is just like 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ···
The formula of this series is just $\begin{cases} l_i = 1 (i<=2) \\ l_i = l_{i-2}+l_{i-1}(i>2) \end{cases}$

### Problem

given the number n, and get the $n_{st}$ number in the Fibonacci series.

### Solution

#### Solution one: brute force

Just simulate the process

```python
def fib(n):
 if n<=2:
  return 1
 a, b = 1, 1
 for _ in range(n-2):
  a, b = b, a+b 

 return b
```

#### Solution two: matrix fast exponentiation

To understand this algorithm, you should have some knowledge of **linear algebra** and **fast exponentiation.**

If the determinate we have now is $(a, b)$, and the next determinate we want to get by linear transformation is $(b, a+b)$, what should we do?

It's easy to draw that (a, b) *$\begin{pmatrix}{0}&{1}\\{1}&{1}\end{pmatrix}$ = (b, a+b)
The matrix fast exponentiation is a combination of matrix and exponentiation, so the result is the first row and the second col num of $\begin{pmatrix}{1}&{1}\\{0}&{0}\end{pmatrix}$* $\begin{pmatrix}{0}&{1}\\{1}&{1}\end{pmatrix} ^ {n-2}$

```python
def m_mul(a, b):
	ans_m = [[0 for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(2)]
	for k in range(2):
		for i in range(2):
			for j in range(2):
	   			ans_m[i][j] += a[i][k]*a[k][j]
	   			ans_m[i][j] %= MOD

  return ans_m


def fib(n):
	if n <= 2:
		return 1

	ans_m = [[1, 1], [0, 0]]
	base_m = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]
	k = n-2
	while k:
		if k&1:
			ans_m = ans_m * base_m 
		base_m *= base_m
		k >>= 1

	return ans_m[0][1]
```
