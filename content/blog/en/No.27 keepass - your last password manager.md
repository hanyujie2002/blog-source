The KeePass is supported by all mainstream systems such as macOS, Windows and Android.

To get started with KeePass, you could download it from the official website of it easily.

Then, create the database which would be better to be verified by both the password and the key file to improve the safety.

Then, reopen the KeePass database by the WebDAV link of your database, and then just operate this database as if operating your local database file.
