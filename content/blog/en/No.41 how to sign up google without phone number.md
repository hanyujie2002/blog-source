# How to sign up Google without phone number

At least ten year ago(2012), there is no phone number needed to sign up Google. However, in 2022, things changed, whenever signing up a Google account, you will be required to give your phone number to "ensure you are not a robot". However, associating with phone number could be vulnerable as the phone number is associated with your private information. Using virtual number is not as useful as in the past, as most of the virtual number is disabled by Google for signing up too many times.

There are two main ways to sign up Google account without phone number:


* In mobile phone: Download the Google official app as signing up in it is not phone number needing.

* In PC: Download the Google Chrome, and sign up in it.
