# Have a try for Linux

## Windows era

Today, most people are using **Windows** as their PC operating system for the main reason that it's the only system on their PC. There are also many critics on **Windows** such as its hardware requirement is more and more high as that Win11 can't run on some old PC.

If you don't like Windows or you just want to have a try of another operating system, you should have a try of Linux.

## What is Linux

The full name of Linux is GNU/Linux whereas the latter part only corresponds to the core of the system, and we are actually talking about GNU, the former part of GNU/Linux while talking about Ubuntu, CentOS or Arch. It's a common phenomenon that not understanding it, just have an impression of it is enough.

## First try of Linux

The best means by which to try Linux for a noob is Virtual machine software for instance VMware and VirtualBox of which the former is easier to use while the latter is FOSS.

1. Download the VMWare Player edition which is the free edition of VMWare pro, the main function is included in it so don't worry.

2. Download a ISO file of any Linux distribution and Ubuntu is the most recommended for noob. Take care that download the file from official site to prevent cyberattack.

3. Run VMWare and create a new virtual machine with your ISO file

4. Just follow the instruction of the installation process and everything goes well.

5. Enjoy it!
