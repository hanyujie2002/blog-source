There has been a long debate on which is the best editor between **Vim** and **Emacs**, which is called "The editor war". I prefer Vim better than Emacs and here is why.

## Hand not leaving the keyboard

In most of the conditions, while editing a document with other document editors, one usually has to move his hand to the arrow key when he wants to move the cursor inconveniently.

However, this problem was solved with vim editing with moving cursor only with "h" corresponding to $\leftarrow$, "j" corresponding to $\downarrow$, "k" corresponding to $\uparrow$, "l" corresponding to $\rightarrow$ which is easy to type without leaving the keyboard.

## Mouse free

Vim is the successor of Vi, which date back to when mouse had not been invented. So, using mouse is not necessary while using Vim, which means that it's very suitable for editing documents on a remote server with SSH.

## Efficiency

Vim is strong enough for almost any operation you want, such as moving the cursor anywhere, cut, copy and replace.

## End

It's hard not to commit that Vim is at least one of the best editor of the world which editing could be a happy trip with, have a try with it and enjoy!
